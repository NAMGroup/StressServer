Basic instructions on how to run the basic stress server:
{PATH_TO_EXECUTABLE}/uvicorn  stress_server:app --reload
The --reload flag is for development purposes only to allow changes in code during run time. Remove this flasg for production.

A number of API endpoints are defined.
These endpoints will stress the cpu of the system for a specific time period.
Ways to stress:
    Default: Stress 1 cpu for 10 seconds.
    Custom: Define CPUs to stress (1-12) and duration (1-100 seconds)
   
The endpoints are defined as both GET and POST to allow easy use from either browser, console or application like POSTMAN
GET:
default: http://localhost:15000/stress                        (1 cpu, 1 second)
custom:  http://localhost:15000/stress/?cpu=4;duration=20     (4 cpus, 20 seconds)
         http://localhost:15000/stress/?cpu=4                 (4 cpus, 1 second(default) )
         http://localhost:15000/stress/?duration=20           (1 cpu(default), 20 seconds)

CURL examples
GET
    curl http://localhost:15000/stress/?cpu=4;duration=20
    curl http://localhost:15000/stress/

SIMULATE MULTIPLE CLIENTS:
Another endpoint has been defined:
    http://localhost:15000/sim_clients
    This will simulate 10 (default) calls to the stress API. This means that 10 stress jobs of 1 second each will be deployed and redirected.
    Parameters:
        http://localhost:15000/sim_clients?clients=X :Simulate X clients
        http://localhost:15000/sim_clients?clients=X;all=True :Simulate X clients
        The all parameter checks whether all the api calls will be redirected or the standard redirection algorithm will be used.
